# 3D Engine

### About this project

This project is meant to regroup some theorical concept into a tiny 3D engine.

It can be seen as a Proof of concept for some ideas I wanted to implement

### Goals

I would like to implement :
  - Quaternions for rotations and interpolation (SLERP)
  - A tree-like structure for relative movement, optimisations are planned
  - Several ways of implementing lights and shadows to compare them
