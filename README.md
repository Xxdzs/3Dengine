# 3D Engine

### About this project

This project is meant to regroup some theorical concept into a tiny 3D engine.

It can be seen as a Proof of concept for some ideas I wanted to implement

Furthermore it allows one to realise a working solution for :
  - Fdf
  - Fractol
  - Wolf3D
  - RT
  - Scop
  - HumanGL

It's a mathematical library.
